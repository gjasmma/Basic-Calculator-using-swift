Enjoy calculating!

Code Overview 🧩
BasicCalculatorApp.swift
App entry point, initializes the SwiftUI view hierarchy.

ContentView.swift
Contains the core UI and calculator logic — handles user input and operation processing.

Info.plist
Standard iOS app configuration.

How It Works ⚙️
Tap numeric and decimal buttons to input numbers.

Select an arithmetic operator to prepare for the operation.

Tap = to get the result.

Use C to clear all input and reset.

Use ⌫ to delete the last entered digit.

The app prevents invalid inputs such as multiple decimals in a single number and handles division by zero gracefully by displaying an error.

Future Improvements 🚧
Add support for parentheses and order of operations

Implement memory functions (M+, M−, MR)

Include scientific calculator features (sin, cos, tan, etc.)

Add animations for button taps and transitions

Support landscape orientation and iPad layouts
